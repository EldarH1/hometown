<h2>About city</h2>
<hr width="100%" size="1" color="black" align="left" noshade="">

<p>Sarajevo is the capital city and largest city of Bosnia and Hercegovina.Sarajevo is the political, financial, social and cultural center of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a prominent center of culture in the Balkans,
with region-wide influence in entertainment, media, fashion and the arts.The name Sarajevo derives from the Turkish noun saray, meaning "palace" or "mansion" (from Persian sarāy, سرای, of the same meaning); academia is
split on the origin of the evo attached to the end. In Slavic languages, the addition of "evo" may indicate a posessive noun, thereby making the name of Sarajevo, 'city of the palace."

1918: Austro-Hungarian Empire collapses. Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.<br><br>

1939-1945: World War II. Nazis occupy Sarajevo, then place it under control of pro-Hitler Croatian fascists, who send thousands of Serbs, Jews and Roma (then commonly called Gypsies) to death camps. The city’s Jewish population, once near 10,000, falls to less than 1,000.<br><br>

1945: Liberated by partisans led by Marshal Josip Broz Tito, Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina become part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.<br><br>

1984: Sarajevo hosts Winter Olympics.<br><br>

1992: As Yugoslavia crumbles, Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats (mostly Catholic) vote for Bosnia-Herzegovina independence. But Bosnian Serbs, mostly Orthodox and backed by Serbia, want Sarajevo and other Bosnian territories to be part of a greater Serbia.<br><br>

1992: Bosnian Serbs besiege Sarajevo, ignoring U.N. protests.<br><br>

1995: Dayton Accords end the siege and war by creating a many-layered government that includes a federation of Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats that shares power with a republic of Bosnian Serbs. Most of Sarajevo’s territory and more than 90% of its residents fall within the federation of Bosnian Muslims and Croats. </p>


<h2>Ottoman Era</h2>
<hr width="100%" size="1" color="black" align="left" noshade="">   
<p>Sarajevo as it is known today was founded by the Ottoman Empire in the 1450s upon conquering the region, with 1461 typically used as the city's founding date. The first known Ottoman governor of Bosnia, Isa-Beg Ishaković, chose the tiny local village of Brodac as a good space for a new city. He exchanged land with
its residents, giving them today's Hrasnica neighborhood in Ilidža), and soon began building his provincial capital as he envisioned it. He quickly built a number of key objects, including a mosque, a closed
marketplace, a public bath, a bridge, a hostel, and the governor's castle ("Saray") which gave the city its present name <br><br>

The late Ottoman era, from 1697 to 1878, saw the decline of the empire, the city, and a number of disasters. The beginning of the late Ottoman era in Sarajevo's history begins with the end of the Austro-Ottoman War.
Following the failure at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the western reaches of the empire were subject to numerous raids. It was the raid of 1697. If the city was no longer what it used to be structure wise, its intellectualism didn't suffer the
slightest. In fact, the 18th century held many of Sarajevo's great thinkers, such as Mehmed Mejlija Guranij and Mula Mustafa Bašeskija. Significant libraries, schools, and mosques were built, as well as
significant new fortifications.
